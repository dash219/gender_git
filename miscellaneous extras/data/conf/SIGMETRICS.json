Papers are open access during the week of the conference, authors have the right to publish them on their website and other non-profit academic archive (arxiv etc.) but they are not required to (unless if they do choose the opt-out option in which the paper is not published in our journal, then they are required to publish it in one of those open archive). Authors also had a choice to publish their paper in a new journal. Unlike proceedings, there is no length limit to the journal version. Some reviews (up to 4 per PC) are designated 'heavy' and are required to verify the technical correctness of the paper.
