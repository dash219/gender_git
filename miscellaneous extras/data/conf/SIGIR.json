    "notes": "There were at least 70 external reviewers in addition to SPC and PC. 1056 authors from 42 countries (299 CN, 232 US, 525 the rest). But not all countries had the same acceptance rate (UK highest with 42%). To increase diversity, the number of Women and people from Asia in the SPC has increased. This isn't a true systems conference; it's included in the data set for comparison. Excluded papers marked as [TOIS], presumably papers previously published in transactions on information systems. Some reviewers (marked below with *award*) were mentioned as outstanding reviewers. Each paper got a meta-review, and if warranted by it, a 4th review by an SPC who hadn't seen the previous reviews.",
